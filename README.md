## About Me
I'm new to cybersecurity but passionate about protecting systems from threats. I've completed basic training and hands-on projects using tools like VirusTotal and Splunk.

## Projects

### Phishing Email Investigation
**What I Did**: I analyzed a suspicious email to check if it was a phishing attack (a fake email trying to steal info).

**Tools I Used**:
- VirusTotal: To scan email headers for known bad stuff.
- Splunk: To search logs for patterns.
- Wireshark: To look at network traffic.
- MITRE ATT&CK: To map out the attack type (like T1566 - Phishing).

**Steps I Took**:
1. Opened the email and copied its headers (technical info like sender details).
2. Pasted them into VirusTotal to see if they were malicious.
3. Used Splunk to check if similar emails appeared in logs.
4. Ran Wireshark to watch for weird connections.

**What I Learned**: I found a fake URL in the email and learned how to spot phishing faster.
